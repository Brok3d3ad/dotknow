## Project Overview
This project is an SVG to JSON processor tool designed for automation standards. It consists of a GUI application that allows users to:
1. Browse and select SVG files
2. Process SVG files by extracting SVG elements and their attributes
3. Convert these elements into JSON format for use in automation systems
4. Copy results to clipboard or save to file
5. Export to Ignition SCADA project structure as a zip file

## Main Components

### 1. SVG Processor GUI (`svg_processor_gui.py`)
- Tkinter-based graphical user interface
- Handles file selection, configuration, and user interaction
- Displays processing results and output
- Features black and yellow theme with automation standard branding
- Implements SCADA project export functionality

### 2. SVG Transformer (`inkscape_transform.py`)
- Core processing engine that parses SVG files
- Extracts SVG elements (rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, etc.) and their transformations
- Converts them to the required JSON format
- Handles complex SVG transformations (translate, scale, rotate, matrix)

### 3. Supporting Files
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies (numpy, Pillow, pyinstaller)
- `test-requirements.txt`: Lists testing dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov, mock)
- `app_config.json`: Stores application settings and user preferences
- `automation_standard_logo.jpg`: Branding image displayed in the application

## Technology Stack
- Python 3
- Tkinter for GUI
- XML parsing with ElementTree and minidom
- JSON processing
- NumPy for matrix transformations
- PIL/Pillow for image handling
- Pytest for testing
