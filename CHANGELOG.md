## Project Overview
An SVG to JSON processor tool for automation standards that:
1. Processes SVG files by extracting elements and attributes
2. Converts elements to JSON format for automation systems
3. Exports to Ignition SCADA project structure as zip files

## Main Components

### 1. SVG Processor GUI (`svg_processor_gui.py`)
- Tkinter GUI for file handling, configuration, and user interaction
- SCADA project export functionality
- Black and yellow theme with automation standard branding

### 2. SVG Transformer (`inkscape_transform.py`)
- Parses SVG files and extracts elements
- Handles complex SVG transformations (translate, scale, rotate, matrix)
- Converts to required JSON format

### 3. Supporting Files
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `app_config.json`: Application settings
- `automation_standard_logo.jpg`: Branding image

## Technology Stack
- Python 3, Tkinter, XML parsing
- JSON processing, NumPy, PIL/Pillow
